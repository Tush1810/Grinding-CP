* Solved on my own and learn lots of new things.
* There is a difference between Arrays.sort(Object[]) and Arrays.sort(int[]).
* Arrays.sort(Object[]) uses TimSort algorithm giving us a time complexity of O(n log(n)). TimSort makes use of the Insertion sort and the MergeSort algorithms.
* Arrays.sort(int[]) uses a Dual-Pivot Quicksort algorithm. This algorithm offers O(n log(n)) average time complexity. In the worst case, its time complexity is O(n2).
* Good problem
