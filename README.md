# Just doing this to be better at cp and maintain consistency
I would try to solve some(at least 5) good level problems each day mainly from codeforces, leetcode, gfg or codechef(very rare).<br>
Hope i stay motivated :,(<br>
P.S. - I will count the problems i solve in any contest that i give as well :)<br>
Thanks and wish me luck !!
