# Just doing this to be better at cp and maintain consistency
I would try to solve some good level problems each day mainly from codeforces(mostly), leetcode, gfg, interview bit or codechef(very rare).<br>
Hope i stay motivated :,(<br>
P.S. - I will count the problems i solve in any contest that i give as well :)<br>
Thanks!!
